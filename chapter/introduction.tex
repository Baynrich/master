\chapter{Introduction}
The first chapter of a well-structured thesis is always an introduction, setting the scene with background, problem description, objectives, limitations, and then looking ahead to summarize what is in the rest of the report. This is the part that readers look at first---\emph{so make sure it hooks them!}

\section{Background}
In this section, you should present the problem that you are going to investigate or analyze; why this problem is of interest; what has, so far, been done to solve the problem, and which parts of the problem that remain.
Remember to cite stuff~\cite{FowlerTechnicalDebt}, and use acronyms like \gls{saas} and \gls{saas}
